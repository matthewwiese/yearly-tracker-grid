# Yearly Tracker Grid in LaTeX
I wanted to make my girlfriend a birthday gift. She likes the yearly grid journaling style where you color in each cell according to a legend. [This listing](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1587888220/yearly-trackers-bundle-printable-journal) on Etsy being a great example of the format.

Since the design is pretty simple, I figured I could make a generic template in LaTeX for both her use and anybody else who likes the journaling technique.

The problem is, I haven't meaningfully used LaTeX in years! However, in under an hour of chatting with Perplexity AI I managed to throw together almost exactly what I had in mind. For the curious, [this is the thread](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/latex-sudoku-how-to-draw-grid-arNgsLq7TCG2hIh4NO.6KQ).
